The default content data file is modified but truncated, so phone/address defaults and admin editor fallback cannot be fully verified from provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Public site Contact card shows a line reading exactly: \"Phone: +91 94508 14050\" and phone remains its own dedicated phone line.",
