  "summary": "Diff adds a full single-page Royal Cafe marketing site composed of NavBar + Hero/About/Highlights/Menu/Gallery/Reviews/Contact sections with smooth scrolling, themed Tailwind styling, centralized content data, gallery lightbox, and SEO metadata. However, the Popular Picks content does not explicitly cover the required category set (notably “specials” and clearly-labeled category cards), and the diff introduces Internet Identity authentication-related hooks/provider which were explicitly disallowed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Popular Picks (highlights) section must showcase key categories/items: tea, coffee, snacks, fast food, and optional specials (with at least those categories represented).",
      "reason": "The implemented highlights are a list of specific items (e.g., Special Chai, Filter Coffee, Samosa, Veg Sandwich, Pakora Plate, Cold Coffee) and do not clearly include/label all requested categories—especially no explicit “specials” category/card and no explicit category representation for all required groups.",
