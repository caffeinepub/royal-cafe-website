  "summary": "REQ-43 appears implemented in Footer.tsx by rendering address/phone/hours from content.contactInfo with defaults and splitting hours by newline while retaining existing footer links. REQ-45 appears partially implemented in ContactLocationSection.tsx by reading contactInfo fields with fallbacks and splitting hours by newline, but the diff is truncated before showing the actual rendering for hours and contact/phone card. REQ-44 (admin editor Contact Info tab edits/saves all three fields without overwriting others) cannot be verified from the truncated EditorPage.tsx diff; the shown portion does not include any contactInfo editing UI or update logic.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the admin Editor \"Contact Info\" tab allows editing and saving address, phone, and business hours (supporting newlines) via the existing save flow, without overwriting other fields.",
      "reason": "EditorPage.tsx is truncated and the visible portion does not show any Contact Info tab inputs for address/phone/hours, nor any specific update logic ensuring edits do not overwrite sibling fields.",
