# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Contact & Location section to display the new phone/address formatting, and remove Instagram as an available social option across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the ContactLocationSection display values to show:
  - Phone line exactly as: "Phone: +91 94508 14050"
  - Address text exactly as: "Royal Cafe, Street 1, Varpur, Mau, Uttar Pradesh" (allowing line breaks without changing the text)
- Ensure the Admin Editor "Contact Info" tab uses the updated phone/address as the default/fallback when no saved content exists.
- Remove Instagram as an available social platform across the public UI (including the footer icon/link and any other Instagram social/contact rendering).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated phone and address in the Contact & Location section, and no Instagram icon/link (or Instagram URL) appears anywhere on the site.
