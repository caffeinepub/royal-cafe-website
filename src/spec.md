## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page, mobile-first marketing website for “Royal Cafe, Varpur (Mau, Uttar Pradesh)” with a warm, cozy, slightly royal theme and clear scroll navigation across key sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page layout with anchor/scroll navigation for: Hero, About, Highlights, Menu, Gallery, Reviews, and Contact/Location.
- Implement a cohesive visual theme (warm palette with elegant “royal” accent) across typography, spacing, buttons, cards, and section styling.
- Create a hero section with the exact name “Royal Cafe”, tagline “Fresh Tea, Great Taste, Everyday Moments”, and CTAs (“View Menu”, “Visit Us Today”) that scroll to the Menu and Contact/Location sections.
- Add an About section with simple, scannable copy covering: quality taste, friendly atmosphere, affordable pricing, and comfortable seating for friends/family.
- Add a “Popular Picks” highlights grid covering tea, coffee, snacks, fast food, and specials, driven from a single editable in-code data list.
- Create a grouped, phone-optimized Menu section (Tea, Coffee, Snacks, Fast Food) with item names and editable price placeholders.
- Add a responsive Gallery (≥6 images) with alt text and tap-to-enlarge modal/lightbox behavior.
- Add a Reviews/Testimonials section (3–6) with authentic, simple local-style quotes and names/initials.
- Add a Contact & Location section showing “Varpur, Mau, Uttar Pradesh”, business hours, contact details, an embedded Google Map iframe, and an “Open in Google Maps” link.
- Ensure mobile performance/accessibility basics: responsive layout, optimized images, headings/contrast, and SEO metadata (title + description).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can quickly scroll through an inviting Royal Cafe landing page on mobile, view menu items and popular picks, browse a tappable gallery, read testimonials, and find hours/contact info with an embedded map and Google Maps link.
